# simple-budget-tracker

This is a simple budget tracking mobile application. I wanted a simple manual tracking app that I can easily track my expenses with. 

## Why build another budget tracker?

I tried a number of different apps and they always over complicated things, so I thought let me find out why this is so hard to do by building it myself! haha

## Prerequisite

- [Expo-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/#:~:text=Expo%20CLI%20is%20a%20command,your%20app%20in%20a%20simulator): I am using expo since I do not want to set up Xcode or Android studio.

## Tasks to be done

- [ ] Set up application initial structure
- [ ] Find a design from dribble to emulate
- [ ] Tweak the design to fit my needs
- [ ] Pick a UI library
- [ ] Start dividing the screen into components
- [ ] Start listing the apps data
- [ ] Sketch component state
- [ ] Start building!
